This file covers various functionalities of openpyxl libraries.
It would help the user to understand about how excel can be controlled/
modified using python. Following are majorly covered topics:
    1. INSTALLATION OF OPENPYXL AND BASICS
    2. OPENPYXL WRITE DATA TO CELL
    3. OPENPYXL APPEND VALUES
    4. OPENPYXL READ DATA FROM CELL
    5. OPENPYXL SHEETS
    6. OPENPYXL MERGING CELL AND FREEZE THE PANES
    7. OPENPYXL FORMULAS
    8. ADDING CHART TO EXCEL FILE
    9. ADDING IMAGE TO EXCEL
